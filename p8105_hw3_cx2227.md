## Problem 1

``` r
library(p8105.datasets)
data("instacart")

str(instacart)
```

### Short description

  - The `instacart` dataset has 1384617 observations and 15 variables.
  - There are 4 character variables and 11 numeric variables.
  - This dataset contains data of various products.
  - Some of the key variables are order\_id, product\_id, aisle\_id, and
    days\_since\_prior\_order.
  - For example, Bulgarian Yogurt with prouct id 49302 has been
    reordered once 9 days since the prior
order.

### Part 1: How many aisles are there, and which aisles are the most items ordered from?

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>%
  arrange(desc(n_obs)) 
```

  - There are 134 aisles.
  - The “fresh vegetables” aisle has the most
items.

### Part 2: Make a plot that shows the number of items ordered in each aisle, limiting this to aisles with more than 10000 items ordered. Arrange aisles sensibly, and organize your plot so others can read it.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  group_by(aisle) %>% 
  summarize(n_obs = n()) %>% 
  filter(n_obs > 10000) %>% 
  arrange(aisle) %>% 
  
  ggplot(aes(x = aisle, y = n_obs)) + geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) + 
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(10000,160000,5000)) + 
  labs(x = "Aisle names", y = "Number of items ordered") +
  geom_text(aes(label=n_obs), vjust=-0.3, size=2.5)
```

  - The number if items ordered from aisle “fresh fruits” and “fresh
    vegetables” are way more than others, followed by “packaged
    vegetables fruits” and
“yogurt”.

### Part 3: Make a table showing the three most popular items in each of the aisles “baking ingredients”, “dog food care”, and “packaged vegetables fruits”. Include the number of times each item is ordered in your table.

``` r
instacart %>% 
  filter(aisle %in% c("baking ingredients", "dog food care", "packaged vegetables fruits")) %>% 
  group_by(aisle, product_name) %>% 
  summarize(tot_order = sum(order_number)) %>% 
  mutate(ord_ranking = min_rank(desc(tot_order))) %>% 
  filter(ord_ranking %in% c(1,2,3)) %>% 
  arrange(aisle, ord_ranking) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```
